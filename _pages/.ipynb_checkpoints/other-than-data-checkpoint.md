I believe in connection, serendipity, perseverance, repetition, balance. I act if itâ€™s about any one in the above list.

All the below of them entities makes me want to live more:

Music discovery, Logic, Dance, Business, Sports

## I say:

##### *"You're built of everything you do..."*

##### *"Actions are greater than words to silence all the curmudgeons out there..."*

##### *"If you can't outsmart someone, outwork them..."*
<p style="float:right"> - a good old entrepreneur wrote it to me on a napkin at a bar</p>

##### *"Life is hard but definitely rewarding. We all live for that very small fraction of AHA! moments and keep moving on..."*

##### *"Question everything, believe nothing..."*
