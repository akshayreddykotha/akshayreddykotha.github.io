I believe in connection, serendipity, perseverance, repetition, balance. I act if it’s about any one in the above list.

All the below of them entities makes me want to live more:

Music discovery, Logic, Dance, Business, Sports

## I say:

##### *"Original Ideas win organically..."*

##### *"If you don’t have anything nice to say, take a big bite and chew slow..."* - The Short Drop

##### *"You're built of everything you do..."*

##### *"Actions are greater than words to silence all the curmudgeons out there..."*

##### *"Question everything, believe nothing..."*

##### *"Not everyday is the same..."*

##### *"One can't run away from facts of life..."*
