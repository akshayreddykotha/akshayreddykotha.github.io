I have 2+ years of industry work experience in the informational technology, e-learning product companies. I am a self-motivated analytics enthusiast inclined to generating actionable insights to support decision making and ultimately boost profitability. Graduated from Masters in Business Analytics at UC San Diego and available full-time immediately to get into a data journey for the greater good.
Feel free to click the [Works](https://akshayreddykotha.github.io/works/) to unveil the projects I worked on). Furthermore, I enjoy working on modelling and the interesting part to me is translating those results into an easy-to-understand language be it business or for fun.
