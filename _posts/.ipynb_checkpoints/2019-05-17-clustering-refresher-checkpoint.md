Below is a sample notebook on my kaggle dashboard which showcases how clustering was implemented to group the states in the US using different crime numbers.

Various aspects of the notebook:
1. Data normalization
2. Fit K-means model
3. Get scree plot and decide on the number of clusters
4. Fit final K-means model and get clusters
5. Write clusters column along with others into a CSV
6. Visualize clusters for different crimes on a scatter plot and among states on tableau
